Another benefit of singing to the Lord is that it exposes us to some of the benefits of hymns in worship. According to some sources , hymns can help us to:

- Keep in touch with our Christian heritage and learn from the experiences and testimonies of previous generations of believers.
- Expose us to some of the greatest music and poetry ever written, which can enrich our minds and hearts with beauty and truth.
- Give our worship a sense of majesty and beauty, as we praise God with songs that reflect His greatness and glory.
- Edify, encourage, and teach one another, as we sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs that convey biblical doctrines and principles.
- Relax our bodies and calm our emotions, as we listen to gentle and inspirational songs that alleviate stress and anxiety.

Singing to the Lord is not only a duty, but also a delight. It is a way to express our love and gratitude to Him, as well as to enjoy His presence and grace. As we sing hymns, we join with the heavenly choir that praises God day and night. Revelation 5:9-10 says:

> "And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals; for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth."

Let us sing to the Lord with our hearts, not only with our lips. Let us sing hymns that glorify Him, not only those that please ourselves. Let us sing hymns that edify ourselves and others, not only those that entertain us. Let us sing hymns that fill us with His word, not only those that express our feelings. Let us sing hymns that prepare us for His coming, not only those that comfort us in this world.
  
Harpa Crista Vol 2 Mattos Nascimento Playback is a wonderful tool to help us sing to the Lord with hymns that are rich in content, melody, and emotion. Whether we sing alone or with others, we can use this album to worship God in spirit and truth. May the Lord bless us as we sing to Him with all our heart.
